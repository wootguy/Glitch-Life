glitch-life todo:

GL_UPLOAD 16 error c1a0
TEST: stadium3 monsters not renamed
speedup res generation somehow?


Nice-to-haves:

detailtextures?
bypass all players must be inside  c1a4b c2a5b (c3a1a?) c3a1b
c1a2e (how did this changelevel ever work?)
dont make spinning things and doors take forever
better osprey replacements? Apache player model chance?
entity randomization configuration (modify chances/value ranges)
monster models aren't all actually monsters
replace { textures with random { textures (or just rename?)
weapon_strip for impulse 101?
combinable texture corruption

Flipping:
door directions messed up a bit (c4a1a, others)

scaling:
per-axis scaling (buggy, causes crash on c1a3 after shooting tripmine)

Future:
content creation (models, sprites, skyboxes, sounds?)
create randomized models (break bones, anims, textures, etc.)
custom map music? (e.g. moonlight sonata for greyscale tex mode)
