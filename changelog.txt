Fixes:
- Fixed model replacement crash: player model with T submodel used for p_weapon
- Fixed model replacement crash: model with missing animation submodels used for p_weapon
- Fixed invalid models being used for replacement (e.g. valve/models/doctor.mdl)

- Fixed WADs with "gsrand" in the name being used for randomization
- Fixed custom prefixes being cutoff in shared WAD names
