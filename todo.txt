glitch-life todo:

crash when just 1 wad and 1 map
impulse 101 cheat is leaving stuff behind

monsters getting super long names? (vinesauce ep.3)
GL_UPLOAD 16 error c1a0
TEST: stadium3 monsters not renamed
speedup res generation somehow?
model replacement for random friendlies didnt work
crashes from gibshooters (op4 boss)
repariable breakables are just confusing/irritating
black maps too likely? increase light brightness?
some textures not BW in write to map mode? (looked like xeno_grapple)

Nice-to-haves:

detailtextures?
c1a2e (changelevel if doors are broken)
dont let spinning things and doors take forever
better osprey replacements? Apache player model chance?
entity randomization configuration (modify chances/value ranges)
monster models aren't all actually monsters
weapon_strip for impulse 101?
combinable texture corruption
replace { textures with random { textures (xeno_grapple though...)
random footstep sounds (won't work with xeno_grapple...)
animated textures don't work (and probably won't with xeno_grapple in use)

Flipping:
door directions messed up a bit (c4a1a, others)

scaling:
per-axis scaling (buggy, causes crash on c1a3 after shooting tripmine)

Future:
Random monster spawns (Trempler's request)
content creation (models, sprites, skyboxes, sounds?)
create randomized models (break bones, anims, textures, etc.)
custom map music? (e.g. moonlight sonata for greyscale tex mode)
