glitch-life todo:

no more super dense fog plz
search svencoop_addon or svencoop, stop searching valve
crash when just 1 wad and 1 map
file extensions missing if they're turned off in windows
crash when randomizing hlsp in 5.0
hlsp maps changed

animated textures don't work
monsters getting super long names? (vinesauce ep.3)
xentree not randomized (can it be?)
GL_UPLOAD 16 error c1a0
TEST: stadium3 monsters not renamed
speedup res generation somehow?
model replacement for random friendlies didnt work
longjump module not randomized
crashes from gibshooters (op4 boss)
repariable breakables are just confusing/irritating
black maps too likely? increase light brightness?
some textures not BW in write to map mode? (looked like xeno_grapple)
flip custom barnacle models so you can actually see them
wads not saying "excluded X" when using content modes

Nice-to-haves:

detailtextures?
bypass all players must be inside  c1a4b c2a5b (c3a1a?) c3a1b
c1a2e (how did this changelevel ever work?)
dont make spinning things and doors take forever
better osprey replacements? Apache player model chance?
entity randomization configuration (modify chances/value ranges)
monster models aren't all actually monsters
replace { textures with random { textures (or just rename?)
weapon_strip for impulse 101?
combinable texture corruption

Flipping:
door directions messed up a bit (c4a1a, others)

scaling:
per-axis scaling (buggy, causes crash on c1a3 after shooting tripmine)

Future:
Random monster spawns (Trempler's request)
content creation (models, sprites, skyboxes, sounds?)
create randomized models (break bones, anims, textures, etc.)
custom map music? (e.g. moonlight sonata for greyscale tex mode)
